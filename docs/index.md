Course Syllabus
---------------

**Learning goals**:
The goals of the course is to get acquainted with modern computational methods
used in physical sciences, including numerical analysis methods, data science and Bayesian statistics. 
We will introduce a number of concepts that are useful in physical sciences at varying depth levels. We will cover main numerical methods used in physical sciences. Most of the statistical concepts will be Bayesian, 
emphasizing the concepts that have a connection to physical sciences, such as classical and statistical mechanics. We will focus on data science and data analysis applications that are often encountered in real world of physical sciences. We will review many of the machine learning concepts and methods. 

**Target audience**:
Target student population are upper division undergraduates from physical science departments, as well as beginning graduate students from the same departments. The course is also suitable for graduate students looking for an introduction to programming and numerical 
methods in phython.

**Course structure**:
Each week there will be a set of 3 hour lectures discussing theoretical and practical underpinnings of the specific topic,
together with its most common applications in physical sciences. Class participation is expected in the form of weekly reading the lecture in advance, submitting comments and questions on the lecture and answering a short set of questions. There will be eight python based homework assignments, applying the methods to physical science based applications. A weekly one hour discussion will focus on the lecture material and homeworks. There will be 3 longer projects spread over the term.

**Prerequsites**: <br>
Undergraduate students: basic introduction to Python programming at the level of PHY77 or permission from instructor. <br>
Graduate students: none. 

**Grades**: 40% projects, 40% homeworks, 20% quizzes.

Software
--------

We will use Python Jupyter hub environment. You are expected to use existing numerical analysis routines and not write your own. Most of these are already
implemented in python libraries (scipy, numpy...).

Homeworks and Projects
------------------------

Throughout the course, students will complete and electronically submit one homework assignment (code) per week.
This code will be run on test cases to check if it produces appropriate results. Students are encouraged to discuss 
homeworks with other students, but should submit their own solutions. Homeworks will use the concepts developed in the 
lectures and apply to relatively simple problems. 

Projects are larger assignments intended to teach you how to combine ideas from the course in interesting ways and apply them 
to real data. There are three projects during the semester. You are encouraged to complete projects in pairs; your partner should be another student in your section. Work together to ensure that both group members understand the complete program you create.

Homeworks and projects are to be submitted using Jupyter notebook in Python.

Sample projects: 

1) **Planck satellite data analysis**: use measurement of Planck satellite power spectrum to determine cosmological parameters. First use linear algebra to solve the least square problem and find MAP/MLE best fit parameters. Next use optimization to solve for the same. Determine covariances of all parameters using Laplace approximation. Make predictions for future experiments with lower noise using Fisher matrix experiment design predictions. Use Planck published MCMC chains and analyze their burn-in phase, Gelman-Rubin statistics, and chain correlations. Plot their 1-d and 2-d distributions and compare them to MAP/Laplace approximation. Change one parameter and use importance sampling to produce new posteriors.  

2) **LIGO Nobel prize data analysis**: use matched filtering methods and FFT to analyze first LIGO event and show it has detected gravitational waves.

3) **Machine learning on galaxies**: use SDSS galaxy flux photometric measurements and redshift measurements to train the ML algorithms for regression, determining the redshift. Use verification data to test the training algorithms. Try KNN, gaussian processes, linear and quadratic regression, support vector machines, neural networks, random forest... Next try classification: use galaxy zoo galaxy morphology (spirals ellipticals, irregulars...) training data and apply to SDSS. Use photometry first, then add image information and observe how the accuracy improves.
